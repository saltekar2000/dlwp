Jupyter notebooks for the book "Deep Learning with Python" by F. Chollet.

The author provides highly polished Jupyter notebooks at https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks. This repository contains my own versions of those notebooks.  The primary reason I don't just copy the authors repository is my belief that I will retain more information by actually typing in the examples from the book.
